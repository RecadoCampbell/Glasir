--Background file indexing (ID3 tags)--
	Files should be scanned and loaded to the database in the background. 
	Before a daemon is created, a lazy loading system can be made to load the playlist rapidly 
	with limited information but continue processing the file in the background for additional ID3 information.

--Cover Art--
	If the folder has cover art, then try to use that.
	Check the album name, artist, and song against a website like Amazon to find the cover art.

--Visualizations--
	Firefox includes a method to obtain visualization information from the audio tags. Include the functionality
	only for Firefox users. Add more visualizations as other browsers adopt the functionality.

--Beats per Minute--
	Process the audio in the database to determine the BPM for each song. This requires background processing.
	Load the BPM into the database to allow custom playlists, like "Fast Songs", "Slow Songs", etc.

--Custom playlists/Searches--
	- Songs listened to most
	- Songs listened to least
	- Artist
	- Album
	- Year
	- Song name

--Song Preview--
	If the player is paused and the user hovers over a song in the playlist then play a short sample (10 seconds?)
