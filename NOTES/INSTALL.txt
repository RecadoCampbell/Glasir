Requirements: 
	Install mpg321

Step 1: 
	Copy 'config.inc.php.default' to 'config.inc.php' and configure the appropriate variables. Choose a database name that works for you, such as 'Glasir'.

Step 2: 
	Create a blank database with the name you chose, like 'Glasir' and assign appropriate permissions for the user account.

Step 3:
	Run db.sql to create the database tables. Note, these tables may change as time goes on. See the next item for updates.
	* For updates you may check out db_updates.sql (if it's available). This will record all changes that the database has gone through in order. 
		It is based on the db_original.sql file and will include version numbers for all changes. 
		Find the next highest version number to your system and run everything below the line to update your database. 

Step 4: 
	Create a temp directory, chmod to 777.
